Cyber Deception AI using Python
Why did we choose to work on cyber deception AI? Simply put, we're fascinated by the idea of turning the tables on hackers. Instead of just trying to block attacks, what if we could actively mislead attackers by feeding them fake but convincing data and decoy systems?
Our project fits within the broader field of intrusion detection, but with a twist. Traditional intrusion detection is mostly reactive - it focuses on identifying unauthorized access after it happens.
